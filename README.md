# Voice Assistant Application

This is a Python-based Voice Assistant application that integrates **text-to-speech (TTS)**, **speech recognition**, and **web automation** to provide a comprehensive voice-based assistant. The app supports multiple text-to-speech engines, including online services and Microsoft's Neural voices, and can also recognize speech through a web interface.

## Features

### 1. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- **Multiple TTS Engines**:
  - **Web-based TTS**: Uses Selenium to automate interactions with web services like `readloud.net`. Voices such as "Brian" (British) and "Joey" (American) are available.
  - **Microsoft's Neural TTS**: Uses `edge_tts` to convert text into high-quality neural voices (e.g., `Madhur` for Hindi). Speech is generated and played locally using `pygame`.
- **Custom Responses**: Predefined text responses for specific conditions, such as long text, are automatically played when appropriate.
  
### 2. Speech Recognition
- **Browser-Based Speech Recognition**: Uses the `webkitSpeechRecognition` API in an HTML file to capture and transcribe spoken words in the browser. The captured text can be further processed or converted into speech.
  
### 3. Sound Detection (Clap Recognition)
- **Clap Detection**: The app can detect clapping sounds using the `sounddevice` library. This can trigger actions in the app based on sound input.

### 4. Web Automation
- **Selenium Web Automation**: The app uses Selenium to interact with web-based text-to-speech services like `readloud.net`, automating text input and speech generation.

### 5. Error Handling
- The application automatically retries failed operations when interacting with web-based services, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- The following Python libraries are required:
  - `selenium`
  - `webdriver_manager`
  - `chromedriver_autoinstaller`
  - `pygame`
  - `edge_tts`
  - `asyncio`
  - `numpy`
  - `sounddevice`
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `speechrecognition`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd voice-assistant-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

#### Text-to-Speech
- **TTS1.py** and **TTSone.py**: These files interact with online TTS services like `readloud.net`.
  - Run either script using:
    ```bash
    python TTS1.py
    # or
    python TTSone.py
    ```

- **TTS2.py**: This file uses Microsoft's Neural voice API and plays speech locally using `pygame`.
  - Run the script using:
    ```bash
    python TTS2.py
    ```

#### Speech Recognition
- **Voice.html**: Open this file in a browser (preferably Chrome) to use web-based speech recognition. Press the **Start Recognition** button to capture voice input.

#### Clap Detection
- **clap.py**: Run this file to detect claps, which can trigger certain actions.
  ```bash
  python clap.py
  ```

### Example Commands
1. **Generate Speech (Local)**:
   - Input text will be converted to speech using either the Microsoft Neural voice (`TTS2.py`) or via web-based services (`TTS1.py`).
2. **Speech Recognition**:
   - Use **Voice.html** to capture spoken input and display it as text in a browser.

## Error Handling
- If any web automation fails (e.g., interaction with the `readloud.net` service), the app will automatically reload the page and retry the operation.
